            <td>Python is a high-level, general-purpose, self-contained programming
                language designed to meet the needs of computer scientists,
                software developers, and college students interested in coding.
                Python was created in the early 1980s by Guido van Rossum
                while he was at IBM. The language is named after its inventor.
                It’s become one of the most popular programming languages in recent history.
                Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamic object-oriented programming
                language that can be used to program applications or web sites.
                It is also known as an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.
                The main benefits of using Python instead of other languages are
                that it is very easy to start programming with and because of its flexible syntax,
                it can be used to program almost any kind of software application.
                Python is an open source language that’s free to use and has a wide
                range of features that make it easy to customize.
                It’s also a great choice for beginners because
                it’s easy to pick up and use. In addition to its ease of use, Python has a number of other features that make it an excellent choice for programmers who want to get into the world of software development. In this article, we will discuss some of the major features of Python that makes it stand out from other languages.

            <td>C++ is quite similar to C programming. In fact, C++ supports all the features offered with C with the addition to various other important features like object-oriented programming, operator overloading, exception and error handling, the namespace feature, and many more. We can say C++ is the advanced version of C programming.
                Features of C++ give multiple reasons to upgrade our skills from C to C++.
